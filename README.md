# ParallelProgram-Bio-Aggression

This is a simulation where we will see a heirarchy establish in a contained environment by introducing a female to an all male population.

Routinely, all the males will begin testing each other and begin forming a hierarchy based on their aggression levels. More aggresive males will rise through the ranking by impressing the female, which will be improved further upon a successful interaction. Eventually, an Alpha will be established. All Beta males may rise to challenge the Alpha, where the victor becomes alpha and the loser is wounded and reduced to the bottom of the hierarchy.

The population will begin diminishing by the following conditions: If a Beta male has a successful interaction with the female, the Alpha is enraged and is guaranteed to challenge the Beta. If the Alpha beats the Beta, the Beta is killed and removed from the running. The population is only decreased by female interaction while an Alpha is present. Once the only agents left over are the Alpha and Female, the simulation ends as they begin their own pack.
